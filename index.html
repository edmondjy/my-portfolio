        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hi, I'm Edmond Yang, a 4th year Data Science student at UC San Diego with a passion for turning data into meaningful insights.â€” a data science enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights from data. 
        My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization, while my projects have allowed me to apply these skills to real-world problems.
        I've worked on projects ranging from predictive modeling and SQL-based analysis to interactive Tableau dashboards, including an exploration of how urban forestry relates to income across New York City neighborhoods.

        I'm experieneced with Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, and I'm always eager to learn new tools and techniques to enhance my data analysis capabilities.As I approach graduation, I'm excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team where I can contribute to impactful data-driven decision-making.
